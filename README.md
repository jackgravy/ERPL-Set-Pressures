Welcome to my set pressure calcualtor!!

Skip this part if you know about DRACO:
DRACO is a bipropellant liquid rocket engine feed system and test stand that is used to hotfire rocket engines for ERPL (Experimental Rocket Propulsion Laboratory) at Embry Riddle. We use a blowdown system that utilises GN2 to 'push' the propellants through the system. 

The purpose of this code is to use waterflow data to find the CdA of the injector and system and then use that to find the pressures required from the GN2 tanks to provide a certain mass flow as per the design requirements of the engine.
